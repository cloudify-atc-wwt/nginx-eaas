# WWT PoC

## Blueprints

* `aws-nginx.yaml` - Instantiates one or more instances on AWS
* `gcp-nginx.yaml` - Instantiates one or more instances on GCP
* `eaas.yaml` - Uses service composition to deploy one or more app servers, configured via Ansible, on AWS or GCP
* `blueprint.yaml` - Placed in [Cloudify-PS/wwt-tf-templates](https://github.com/Cloudify-PS/wwt-tf-templates/blob/master/blueprint.yaml) repo. Uses service composition to deploy GitHub terraform repository.

# Prerequisites

The blueprints assume that you have the following secrets defined:

* `aws_access_key_id` - AWS access key ID
* `aws_secret_access_key` - AWS secret access key
* `gcp_credentials_json` - Credentials file for GCP
* `cloudify_host` - Cloudify Manager address used by GitHub Actions 
* `cloudify_user` - Cloudify Manager username
* `cloudify_password` - Cloudify Manager password
* `github_token` - [GitHub Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) with delete_repo & repo scopes.
* `runner_host` - FQDN/IP of [GitHub self-hosted runner](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/about-self-hosted-runners), eg. `10.255.66.77`
* `runner_vm_user` - Runner's SSH user, eg. `labuser`
* `runner_root_user` - Runner's SSH root, eg. `root`
* `runner_key_private` - Runner's SSH private key

Please make sure that your GitHub self-hosted runner satisfies all [requirements](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/about-self-hosted-runners#requirements-for-self-hosted-runner-machines), and it has Docker installed.
## Usage

First, upload the EaaS secrets file in [secrets/eaas_params_{dev/qa/prod}.json](./secrets/eaas_params_dev.json).

Then, upload the three necessary blueprints: `aws-nginx.yaml`, `gcp-nginx.yaml`, `eaas.yaml` and [terraform repository blueprint](https://github.com/Cloudify-PS/wwt-tf-templates/blob/master/blueprint.yaml).

There is a helper script that you can run to handle this. The script takes one parameter, valid values are:  `dev`/`prod`/`qa`. Cloudify tenants can be changed using [cfy profile](https://docs.cloudify.co/latest/cli/maint_cli/profiles/) from Cloudify CLI.
